        <h1>Owners</h1>
        <p> Jimmy Holmes founded this brand in 2023 after years of working as a head martial arts instructor! He currently owns and runs a martial arts gym in Tomball Texas called Global Martial Arts! He was inspired to make this brand and partner with Proj Zero because throughout the years, he has had many current serving or veterans come to him to learn martial arts or better themselves! Jimmy is a loving father and husband and loves what he does! Outside of work he teaches bible study at his church and loves to spend time with his family!</p>
